matrix M
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

is converted into

matrix A
1  3  6
5  12 21
12 27 45

this is called as prefix sum matrix

the element at i, j contains the sum of all the elements present in left and above, including itself

now if we want to calculate sum of a block of the original matrix M from i = 1, j = 1 to i = 2, j = 2
we can get it by A[2][2] - A[0][2] - A[2][0] + A[0][0]
A[2][2] contains sum of all the elements
A[0][2] contains sum of all the elements of first row
A[2][0] contains sum of all the elements of first column
A[0][0] is subracted twice so we need to add it.
